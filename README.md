**DESCRIPTION FROM WIKIPEDIA: **
Diamond is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Larry Back. 
The invention was inspired by the game Kensington, which uses a similar 
board pattern and game objective. Rules for Diamond were conceived in 1985
and finalized in 1994. Diamond introduces a new board geometry and
neutral pieces, with the aim of enhancing the game dynamic and 
lowering the potential for draws. 

**NUMBER OF PLAYERS :** 2

**GAME RULES: **
The game begins with an empty Diamond board. 
Black moves first, then turns alternate. 
(To offset any advantage Black has in moving first, the pie rule is used:
White can choose to switch sides after Black's first move, playing from then on as Black.
White has this option only after Black's first move.) 
Passing a turn is not permitted.

The game is executed in two phases:

Placement phase. 
Players take turns placing one of their pieces on any open point on the board. 
No placements result in a capture in this phase. 
A player can win the game in this phase if they are able to occupy all four corners of a board square;
otherwise, play proceeds to the Movement phase once all 24 pieces have been placed.
    
Movement phase. 
For their turn, a player may either:
    move one of their pieces along a straight line to an adjacent empty point; or,
    remove a neutral piece from the board—but only if no white or black piece is adjacent to it.
